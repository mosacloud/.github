# What we're building
**mosa.cloud** is a complete workspace solution. We deploy, support, and contribute to the best open source productivity tools. You get a fully managed workspace without the complexity of self-hosting or the trade-offs of big tech.

Our platform includes:

- **Docs** - Real-time collaborative documents with AI assitance
- **Drive** - Secure file storage and sharing with Collabora built-in
- **Meet** - Video conferencing with AI transcripts and action items
- **Mail** - Collaborative email with shared inboxes and live co-editing
- **Matrix** - Secure chat

Our platform builds on [La Suite numérique](https://github.com/suitenumerique), which is already trusted by 200K+ French government workers. This is the same foundation that the German OpenDesk and Dutch MijnBureau projects are built on.

# Why we exist
European organisations need and deserve digital autonomy. Tools and service providers should put your privacy and data ownership over shareholders, profits and vendor lock-in. That's why Open Source was the obvious choice to us. 

With 15+ years of experience as Google Workspace service provider for organisations of all sizes, we know how organisations and teams want to work in the digital era. Now it's time to lead them into the sovereignty era.

# Contributing
We're committed to open source development and upstream contributions. If you find bugs or want to improve our forks, please:

1. Check if the issue exists in the [upstream La Suite repositories](https://github.com/suitenumerique).
2. If it's upstream, contribute there first
3. If it's specific to our implementation, open an issue or PR in the relevant repository

# Want to work with us?
We're building a European network of managed service providers and resellers who want to offer digital sovereignty solutions. We offer MSPs the tools they need to help any organisation achieve digital sovereignty.

# About
Mosa is named after the river flowing through Maastricht, the city where the European Union 🇪🇺 was born. Just as that treaty united nations in collaboration, we're continuing that spirit through open source software.
